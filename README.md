# Water Sensor Library


In this repository you will find the library to use the sensors of the MVP Water Waziup :
 
- atlas DO sensor in I2C mode
 - atlas PH sensor in I2C mode

 - DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor

 - DS18b20 temperature sensor





The following library are required to use the waterSensor lib :

  - [OneWire](https://github.com/RobTillaart/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/DHTlib)

  - [DHT](https://github.com/blissillour/water-sensors/DHT)


To run and compile the MVPBox sketch you will need to add the [SX1272 library](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/tree/master/Arduino/libraries/SX1272)
