# Water Sensor Library


This library help to read the values of the sensors used in the MVP Water Waziup :
 
 - atlas DO sensor in I2C mode
 - atlas PH sensor in I2C mode
 - DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor
 - DS18b20 temperature sensor





The following library are required to use the waterSensor lib :

  - [OneWire](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/OneWire)

  - [DHT](https://github.com/blissillour/water-sensors/tree/master/libraries/DHT)


To run and compile the MVPBox sketch you will need to add the [SX1272 library](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/tree/master/Arduino/libraries/SX1272)
